# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

To learn more about the Hardhat 3 Beta, please visit the [Getting Started guide](https://hardhat.org/docs/getting-started#getting-started-with-hardhat-3). To share your feedback, join our [Hardhat 3 Beta](https://hardhat.org/hardhat3-beta-telegram-group) Telegram group or [open an issue](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/new) in our GitHub issue tracker.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

## Preparing and uploading this repository to GitHub (safe steps)

Follow these steps to upload the project to GitHub while keeping sensitive files (like `.env`) out of the repository.

1. Ensure `.gitignore` contains sensitive paths. This repository includes a `.gitignore` that ignores `node_modules`, `.env*`, deployment artifacts under `ignition/deployments/`, `artifacts/`, and other build caches.

2. Locally initialize git (if not already a repo), add files and commit:

```pwsh
# initialize repo (run once)
git init

# verify .gitignore excludes desired files (especially .env)
git status --ignored

# add files
git add .

# commit
git commit -m "chore: initial commit (excluding sensitive files)"
```

3. Create a GitHub repository. Either use the GitHub web UI or the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Example with `gh` (you must be authenticated):

```pwsh
# create a public repo and push current branch
gh repo create my-bsm-project --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# OR, if you prefer to create manually in the web UI, then add the remote and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4. If you accidentally committed sensitive files, remove them from history before pushing:

```pwsh
# remove file from index and history (example: .env)
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "chore: remove .env from repo"

# To scrub history use tools like `git filter-repo` or the legacy `git filter-branch`.
```

5. (Optional) Add a minimal `SECURITY.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to report sensitive leaks and credentials rotation steps.

If you want, I can initialize a local git commit for you (I can run the commands), or generate a small PowerShell script that automates steps 1–3. Tell me which you prefer.
